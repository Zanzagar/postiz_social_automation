# Gita Valley (formerly Gita Nagari) — Online Presence Audit

**Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Prepared for:** Social media automation project planning  
**Note:** Gita Nagari has officially rebranded to **Gita Valley**. This audit assesses how completely that rebrand has been executed across their digital presence.

---

## 1. Rebrand Status — Gita Nagari → Gita Valley

The rebrand is official on paper but **incomplete across nearly every digital touchpoint**. This is the single biggest issue to address.

| Property | Rebranded? | Details |
|---|---|---|
| **Website** | ✅ Yes | gitavalley.org — fully rebranded, new logo, "Gita Valley" throughout |
| **Instagram handle** | ✅ Yes | @gita.valley with new Gita Valley logo as profile pic |
| **TikTok handle** | ⚠️ Partial | @gitavalley handle + "Gita Valley" name, BUT still uses old "Gita Nagari Eco Farm and Sanctuary" logo, links to gnecofarm.org |
| **Facebook** | ❌ No | Still named **"Gita Nagari Farm"**, old logo, links to gnecofarm.org, contact email is contact@gnecofarm.org, intro says 350 acres (site says 430) |
| **Shopify store** | ❌ No | shopgitanagari.com — "Gita Nagari Creamery" |
| **LinkedIn** | ✅ Yes | "Gita Valley (Gita Nagari Eco Farm)" — transitional naming |
| **Tripadvisor** | ❌ No | "Gita Nagari Yoga Farm" — unclaimed |
| **Yelp** | ❌ No | Listed as "ISKCON" |
| **Google Business** | ❌ Unclear | Likely under old name |
| **Eventbrite** | ❌ No | "Gita Nagari Eco Farm" |
| **FundRazr** | ❌ No | "Gita Nagari" |
| **ISKCON directories** | ❌ No | "Gita Nagari Farm" everywhere |

**Bottom line:** Only the main website and Instagram have been fully rebranded. Everything else — including Facebook (their largest social following) — still says some variant of "Gita Nagari."

## 2. Social Media Accounts — Verified Data

### Instagram: @gita.valley ✅ PRIMARY
- **Followers:** 4,414
- **Following:** 1,085
- **Posts:** 860
- **Logo:** New Gita Valley logo ✅
- **Bio:** "Certified 501(c)(3) Non-profit Farm Sanctuary 🐄 Only USDA Certified Slaughter-free dairy 🧑‍🌾 Certified Organic..."
- **Links:** gitavalley.org + 1 more
- **Threads:** gita.valley (linked)
- **Story Highlights:** YouTube Learn, Volunteer, Book Stay, Sponsor Cows, Donate

**Posting Activity:**
- Most recent post: **November 24, 2025** (11 weeks ago) — generic meme/video, 9 likes, 0 comments
- Prior post: **September 6, 2025** (collab with @monkwhoedits108) — 19 likes, 3 comments
- **Posting frequency: Extremely sporadic**, with multi-month gaps
- **Engagement rate: ~0.2-0.4%** on recent posts (9-19 likes on 4,414 followers)
- Content is mostly Reels/video — good instinct, but inconsistent execution
- Some recent posts appear to be generic/non-original content rather than actual farm content

### Facebook: facebook.com/gitavalley ⚠️ LARGEST FOLLOWING BUT UN-REBRANDED
- **Page name:** "Gita Nagari Farm" (NOT Gita Valley)
- **Followers:** 5,700
- **Following:** 33
- **Reviews:** 48 reviews, **94% recommendation rate**
- **Logo:** Old "Gita Nagari Eco Farm and Sanctuary" logo ❌
- **Contact info:** contact@gnecofarm.org (old domain), gnecofarm.org (old website)
- **Intro:** "Gita Nagari is a 350 acre eco farm..." (website says 430 acres)
- **Featured posts:** From November 2023 — over 2 years old

**Posting Activity:**
- Most recent post: **December 16, 2025** (~2 months ago) — "Early morning in Gita Nagari 🐄🐄" with atmospheric cow photo
- **More active than Instagram** but still sporadic
- Posts still reference "Gita Nagari" in captions
- Has cross-posted Instagram content

### TikTok: @gitavalley ⚠️ SMALLEST FOLLOWING, HIGHEST POTENTIAL
- **Followers:** 198
- **Following:** 111
- **Total likes:** 1,290
- **Logo:** Old "Gita Nagari Eco Farm and Sanctuary" logo ❌
- **Bio:** "🐄 First USDA Certified Slaughter-Free Dairy Farm 🧑‍🌾 Organic CSA"
- **Link:** gnecofarm.org (old domain)
- **Videos:** Error loading on desktop; content exists but sparse

**Critical insight:** The RNS article mentions a viral TikTok that generated **1,200 applications for 54 internship spots**. With only 198 followers on the official account, that viral video almost certainly came from an **intern or visitor's personal TikTok**, not this account. The farm's most viral content is being created by others and not captured by official channels.

### Other Confirmed Platforms
| Platform | Handle/Presence | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Threads** | gita.valley | Linked from Instagram bio |
| **LinkedIn** | Gita Valley (Gita Nagari Eco Farm) | Company page exists |
| **Instagram (legacy)** | @gita.nagari.eco.farm | 5 followers, 0 posts — abandoned |
| **Instagram (secondary)** | @gnadoptacow | Adopt-a-Cow program |
| **Facebook (legacy)** | Gita Nagari Farm (page ID: 293313989490) | May be same as current |

### Missing Platforms (Opportunities)
| Platform | Priority | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **YouTube** | 🔴 CRITICAL | No channel found. Instagram has "YouTube Learn" highlight suggesting they link to other people's YouTube content about them. They have video assets in Google Photos albums. This is the biggest gap. |
| **Pinterest** | 🟡 MEDIUM | Farm aesthetics, recipes, sustainable living — evergreen content discovery engine |

## 4. Engagement & Content Analysis

### The Numbers Tell a Story

| Platform | Followers | Last Post | Typical Engagement | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Instagram | 4,414 | Nov 24, 2025 | 9-19 likes (~0.2-0.4%) | ❌ Dormant, low engagement |
| Facebook | 5,700 | Dec 16, 2025 | Unknown | ⚠️ Sporadic but more recent |
| TikTok | 198 | Unknown | 1,290 total likes | ❌ Barely started |
| Threads | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown | ❓ Presence exists |
| YouTube | N/A | N/A | N/A | ❌ Doesn't exist |

**Engagement rate context:** For a 4K-follower farm/sanctuary account, a healthy engagement rate would be 3-6%. They're getting 0.2-0.4%, which is ~10-20x below where they should be. This is typically caused by: long gaps between posts (algorithm deprioritizes), generic/non-original content, and inconsistent posting times.

### Content Quality vs. Content Consistency

The content that exists is compelling — atmospheric farm photos, cow personality videos, community event documentation. The **problem isn't content quality, it's content consistency**. They appear to post when someone remembers to, rather than on any schedule.

Their most recent Instagram post (Nov 24, 2025) appears to be a generic meme-style video repost about a child, not original farm content. Their second-most-recent was a collab with a visiting creator (@monkwhoedits108). This suggests the account may be managed ad-hoc by whoever is available rather than by a dedicated person with a content plan.

### The Viral TikTok Paradox

The RNS article from April 2025 reports that a single TikTok video from an intern generated 1,200 applications for 54 spots. Meanwhile, the official @gitavalley TikTok has only 198 followers. This means:

1. **The farm's content goes viral when someone actually creates it** — demand exists
2. **The official channels aren't capturing that energy** — no system to repost, collab, or amplify
3. **User-generated content (UGC) is their most powerful asset** — the automation pipeline should include a UGC collection and reposting strategy

---

## 5. What's Working (Strengths to Build On)

1. **Instagram has the Gita Valley rebrand done right** — correct logo, handle, bio, Threads link, story highlights organized by conversion goal (YouTube Learn, Volunteer, Book Stay, Sponsor Cows, Donate)

2. **Facebook has social proof** — 5.7K followers and 48 reviews with 94% recommendation is real social capital that shouldn't be abandoned, just rebranded

3. **The website (gitavalley.org) is excellent** — professional design, comprehensive content, clear navigation, multiple conversion paths (visit, volunteer, intern, donate, shop, adopt-a-cow)

4. **The story sells itself** — "Only USDA Certified Slaughter-Free Dairy Farm" is an unbeatable unique differentiator. The RNS press coverage, Yale listing, and 1,200 internship applications prove the narrative resonates

5. **Rich media assets exist** — Google Photos albums with farm videos, community content, alternative break documentation. These just need to be systematized into a pipeline

## 6. Critical Issues (Priority Order)

### 🔴 P0: Complete the Facebook Rebrand
Facebook is their **largest social following** (5.7K vs Instagram's 4.4K) and has 48 reviews with 94% recommendation. It still says "Gita Nagari Farm" with the old logo, old contact email, old domain link, and outdated intro text. This is confusing visitors who find them on Facebook and then see "Gita Valley" on the website.

**Action items:**
- Change page name to "Gita Valley"
- Update profile photo to new Gita Valley logo
- Update cover photo
- Change website link from gnecofarm.org to gitavalley.org
- Update contact email
- Update intro text (350 → 430 acres, Gita Nagari → Gita Valley)
- Update featured posts (currently from Nov 2023)

### 🔴 P1: Create a YouTube Channel
No YouTube channel exists despite having video content assets and an Instagram story highlight called "YouTube Learn" that suggests they want to be there. YouTube is the #2 search engine in the world and their content (farm tours, cow stories, cooking, sustainability education) is perfect for it.

### 🔴 P2: Fix TikTok
198 followers while a random intern's TikTok went viral and got 1,200 applications. Fix: update logo, update link to gitavalley.org, and most critically — **start posting consistently**. Farm TikTok content has massive organic reach potential.

### 🟡 P3: Claim/Update Third-Party Listings
- Claim Tripadvisor listing, rebrand from "Gita Nagari Yoga Farm"
- Update Yelp from "ISKCON" to "Gita Valley"
- Claim/update Google Business Profile
- Upload photos to FundRazr campaign media galleries

### 🟡 P4: Consolidate Legacy Domains
gnecofarm.org, gitanagari.org, theyogafarm.com should all 301 redirect to gitavalley.org.

## 7. Content Strategy Recommendations

### Platform Priority for Automation Pipeline
1. 🔴 **Instagram** — largest engaged audience, already rebranded. Target: daily posts + stories
2. 🔴 **Facebook** — largest total following, strong reviews. Target: 4-5 posts/week
3. 🔴 **TikTok** — highest growth potential, proven viral content category. Target: 3-5 videos/week
4. 🟡 **YouTube** — needs channel creation first, then weekly long-form. Target: 1-2 videos/week
5. 🟢 **Threads** — mirror Instagram content, minimal extra effort
6. 🟢 **LinkedIn** — university partnerships, impact reporting. Target: 1-2 posts/week
7. 🟢 **Pinterest** — evergreen farm aesthetics, recipes. Target: pin existing content

### Content Pillars
1. **Cow personalities & daily life** (40%) — highest engagement potential, builds parasocial relationships → donations/adopt-a-cow
2. **Farm operations & sustainability** (25%) — educational, positions as thought leader in regenerative ag
3. **Community & people** (15%) — volunteer spotlights, intern stories, visitor testimonials, retreat highlights
4. **Kitchen & food** (10%) — farm-to-table cooking, sattvic cuisine, recipes
5. **Spiritual dimension** (5%) — morning routines, festival celebrations, meditation spaces
6. **Calls to action** (5%) — product sales, donate, visit, volunteer, adopt-a-cow

### The Automation Pipeline Solves Their Core Problem

The root issue isn't that they lack content — it's that **there's no system for turning daily farm life into consistent social media posts**. They have 20 full-time residents, 3,000 retreat visitors/year, interns, and a photogenic 430-acre farm with cows, peacocks, and organic gardens. Content happens every day. It just doesn't get posted.

The n8n + Postiz pipeline solves this by:
- Pulling from a shared content repository (Google Drive/Photos)
- AI-generating platform-optimized captions
- Scheduling posts across all platforms simultaneously
- Optionally routing through an approval step
- Eliminating the "someone has to remember to post" bottleneck

## 8. What to Bring to the Gita Nagari Meeting

1. **This audit** — showing them their own fragmented presence with real data
2. **The rebrand gap list** — Facebook still says "Gita Nagari Farm" to 5,700 people
3. **The engagement problem** — 0.2% engagement vs. 3-6% benchmark
4. **The viral TikTok paradox** — 1,200 applications from someone else's TikTok while official account has 198 followers
5. **The automation proposal** — self-hosted Postiz + n8n at $10-25/month
6. **One key question:** "Who currently posts to social media, and what stops them from posting more often?"
