			"taskTitle": "Create Python project structure and dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - straightforward file creation task",
			"reasoning": "This is a greenfield setup task with no existing code to integrate with. The .gitignore already has `var/*.sqlite`, so partial work exists. Creating pyproject.toml, scripts/, and var/ directories is straightforward. Single atomic task that doesn't benefit from subtasks."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement SQLite database schema and storage layer",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - implementation is fully specified in task details",
			"reasoning": "The task details provide complete implementation code for health_storage.py. This is copy-paste implementation with minor adjustments. Uses stdlib sqlite3 which is well-understood. Schema is simple (2 tables, 2 indexes). All methods are straightforward CRUD operations. No expansion needed since the code is already written."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Docker service health checker",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - implementation is fully specified in task details",
			"reasoning": "Complete implementation is provided in task details. The docker-compose.yaml shows exactly 7 services (postiz, postiz-postgres, postiz-redis, temporal, temporal-postgresql, temporal-elasticsearch, temporal-ui) with container names that match SERVICE_CONTAINERS mapping. 4 of 7 services have Docker healthchecks defined, so the checker leverages existing infrastructure. Moderate complexity due to Docker SDK error handling but all code is pre-written."

		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement state transition detection and webhook notification",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - implementation is fully specified in task details",
			"reasoning": "Full implementation provided. Depends on Tasks 2 and 3 which provide the imports it needs. Webhook retry logic with exponential backoff is standard pattern. Integration between storage and checker is straightforward. No architectural decisions needed - just implement the provided code."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Create main health monitor script",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - implementation is fully specified in task details",
			"reasoning": "This is the orchestration script that ties together Tasks 2, 3, and 4. Full implementation is provided in task details. Uses argparse for CLI which is standard. Two modes (--once and continuous) are both implemented in the provided code. Error handling for Docker daemon connection is included. Straightforward integration task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement CLI for status, history, and uptime queries",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - implementation is fully specified in task details",
			"reasoning": "Full implementation provided with three subcommands (status, history, uptime). Uses argparse subparsers which is standard Python. Colored output uses ANSI codes directly - no external dependency. Depends on storage (Task 2) and checker (Task 3). Output formatting is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Add Makefile targets for health monitoring",
			"complexityScore": 1,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - trivial configuration change",
			"reasoning": "Existing Makefile has 6 targets and is 19 lines. Adding 4 new targets (health, health-history, health-uptime, health-monitor) is a minimal append operation. Each target is a single-line python command. The .PHONY declaration just needs updating. This is a 2-minute task."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Write comprehensive test suite",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down test suite creation into: 1) Test infrastructure setup (conftest.py, pytest config in pyproject.toml), 2) Storage layer tests (test_storage.py), 3) Checker and notifier tests (test_checker.py, test_notifier.py), 4) Integration tests for monitor and CLI (test_monitor.py, test_cli.py)",
			"reasoning": "This is the most complex task despite having example code provided. Requires creating 6 test files plus conftest.py. Needs mock fixtures for Docker client and httpx. Must handle pytest-asyncio if async testing is needed. Integration tests may require Docker to be running. Test patterns span multiple domains (SQLite, Docker SDK, HTTP mocking). Benefits from parallel development of different test categories."

		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Update documentation and .env.example",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed - straightforward documentation updates",
			"reasoning": "Three simple file edits: append to .env.example (3 variables), update CLAUDE.md structure section and commands section, update current focus checkbox. All changes are additive and well-specified in task details. No architectural decisions or code to write."
